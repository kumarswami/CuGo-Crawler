***********Explanation:*********

Channel B (Speed Control): Adjusts the speed of both left and right motors.
Channel C (Direction Control): Determines whether the robot turns left or right based on the joystick position:
Turn Right: Left motor reverses, right motor moves forward.
Turn Left: Left motor moves forward, right motor reverses.
Straight: Both motors move in the same direction as set by Channel B.
Adjust the pulse width ranges (1500 and 1000) in the if conditions based on your specific joystick and motor behavior.
